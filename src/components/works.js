She is drawn into an investigation by Gabe Bennett, a Southern police detective planted in the heart of Yankee territory after a tense divorce. A trail of dead bodies points to prime suspects: Hope, her business woman grandmother and her sex-obsessed cousin. Rumors of witchcraft, demons and curses swirl around the family. As Hope loses her heart to Gabe, she must fight to make sense of a crumbling world where no one is what they seem, including herself. Will she choose family loyalty or freeing the world of evil while destroying the only family she has left?</p></div>

    <div><p className="text-white text-2xl px-8 py-4 max-w-xl text-justify">Baltimore City, the United Major States: Senator Cutter ("The Prophet"), follower of Protestant Reformer Martin Luther, founder of an Evangelical Christian church and a Presidential candidate, orders the release of a weaponized virus onto a city street. Boston, the Outlands: biogeneticist, Meara Flannagan, cures an SIV infected Rhesus monkey with a biotherapy that rewrites DNA in minutes. When her Corp reassigns the drug to her nemesis, Meara steals the formula and flees to the outlaw territories. Sebastian Gates is a saxophone player and hired gun ordered to hunt her. Success is assured until he realizes the job comes with complications. Complications like an attraction to Meara and evasion of a laser-toting assassin who can look like Jackie Onassis one day and Jackie Chan the next. The Senator, Meara and Sebastian are on a collision course- unwitting players in a zero sum game where China and India will destroy anything and anyone in their path to possess what remains of the former United States. Meara and Sebastian are the only hope- for each other and for their country.</p></div>
